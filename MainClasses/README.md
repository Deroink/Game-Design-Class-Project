# About this section of Classes

(For the time being, while the project is in the process of being re-made, this folder will contain all used classes, until they are properly re-made)

Ideally, this folder will host where the main game runs for the majority of the time; game1.cs, program.cs, etc. Once the classes are properly re-made, these will likely be used for simply calling methods of other classes, as well as the methods to draw content, to avoid keeping these classes cluttered with a relatively large amount of code.
