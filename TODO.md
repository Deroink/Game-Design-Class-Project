Concepts Implementation:
  - A* Pathfinding
  - Loading/Unloading multiple levels


Classes to Make:
  - Audio and Input managers - classes used for loading/playing audio files as needed, and handling key (maybe mouse in the future) input, respectively.
  - Input Type handlers - classes for managing how key input is handled during different game states - for example, whether the player is going through a menu, or is playing the game normally.


Classes to Re-make:
  - TBD. Need to assess where improvements are needed the most.
