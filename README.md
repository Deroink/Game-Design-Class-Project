# Game-Design-Class-Project
Developed using the MonoGame framework. Class project for one of my last electives that I handled the code for. 

The code will be present, but the best I can do for art assets, as of writing this (4/14/18) is upload some dummy textures, since the art for the project was done by a friend, so I can't really use it. Same thing with sounds.

For some background information, the class in question simply required a finished game. If you've seen my other projects, you can probably guess most of my work is practiced with C#.
To that end, I wanted to make a game that followed the kind of games I like, tactics RPG games, a grid and turn-based strategy game with RPG elements.
This was a group effort, where other people handled things like art, sound, etc, whereas I just focused on the coding and then asked people for their thoughts.
Most of the other groups wanted to use game engines like Unity or Unreal 4, but I wanted to do more on the coding side of things, for the purpose of practicing code more, so that's why I was stubborn enough to settle on a C# framework, so I could continue to practice, while still being able to challenge myself.

Now, with the background out of the way, the project serves as a single-player game, for players to battle against an AI army, with the goal of winning against the enemy army. As of writing this, the game is mostly playable, but I wanted to put this project on here so I could have it over the course of time, to show progress, as well as improving the code, as I had a lot of fun working on this project, and easily became my most complex work yet, but I want to keep going with it, not to make a commercial product, but to continue to learn new concepts outside of class. This kind of topic will be covered in another document about what I want to do with the project moving forward from the class; implementing efficient rendering of textures, A* pathfinding implementation, as well as cleaning up the code, to make it more organized.
